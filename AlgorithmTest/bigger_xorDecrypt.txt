"For a second I thought 'Oh – she [Leonore] recognises Leo, our bigger dog' but I did think it was unusual and then I saw the lion walk back out the door," she told NBC Bay Area.

"I knew it wasn't Leo because it wasn't her normal bark. Because she plays with Leo a lot, and it didn't seem normal. It's hard to fathom, it's beyond what we thought," she added.

Police said they had been unable to find definite traces of a mountain lion in the bedroom or around the perimeter of Fought's property.

However, she says she is sure she knows what she saw moving out of her bedroom door and that in the morning she found "wet, very clear, large paw prints walking in",

Daughter Catalina was left shaken by the incident but vowed not to let a similar fate befall one of her other pets, saying: "[We will] not let our dogs out at night and fix a lock on the door."

Detective Salvador Zuno, spokesman for the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office told the LA Times: "What's so rare and shocking about this is that the animal comes up to the property and enters the home."
